#Collaborate
Collaborate is a web presence designed to help people grow their ideas into the full projects that they are capable of becoming. Join to meet others, in your field and adjacent fields, that may be able to offer insight into how you can best create your own Startup, and maybe even join you in your endeavors.

I decided on this project after feeling annoyed 
at myself for not keeping better track of my ideas overtime. I needed an idea for a project and hadn't written any down despite the fact that I often have ideas. I first thought it would be nice to have an app to save ideas, but then wondered how I could build upon that. 

Since ideas are often made even better through feedback from others, I decided to include that, which really only left it one step away from being able to create a full Startup, so I figured, why not?

I now have an app in which people can collaborate with others about ideas they have and get feedback and insight from exactly the kind of people that are in the best position to offer that.


Troubles:
	I wanted to have the selection of the role of the person signing up to be a dropdown menu but had a lot of trouble trying to implement reactstrap for that functionality and could not find any other way to do so. I am going for an MVP, maybe I can get this fixed at a later time.

	My background image ia a little wonky when large, I could not get it to respond well to changes in screen size.

	I would like to make the entire app reactive for phone usage.

Project Time's Up Troubles:
	I am unable to set the signup to specify the role of the individual, unable to delete properly or update, and don't have the ability to add comments to projects.
